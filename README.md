# Suunto
My apps for the Suunto Ambit sports watches. I started with the Ambit 2S, and continued on the Ambit 3 Peak.

Programs should work on any watch from the Ambit series, albeit not tested.
The only thing that worked on the Ambit 2S and fails on the Ambit 3 Peak is the "pace monitoring" (see "VMA_*" programs)

NB : program files have a ".js" extension, but code is NOT Javascript at all, it's a SUUNTO-specific language.
I use this extension just for syntax highlighting in my text editor ;-)
